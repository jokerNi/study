  程序员只需在代码中告诉总管所需要的数据精度和数据大致来源，总管就能自动的返回一个最优的Provider来。

 to be set.Valid values are GPS bluetooth mac addresses (e.g. 00:02:76:C5:81:BF) and device names (/dev/pgps).

the first thing to check is if you had the Gypsy provider compiled when
you built geoclue.  There is a summary of what is being built at the end
of the configure script.

Second, is to check if you installed geoclue in /usr.  Because of the
dbus services, it can't be installed elsewhere.  the .service files are
located in /usr/share/dbus-1/services/ so if you can't find
org.freedesktop.Geoclue.Providers.Gypsy.service there, the provider
cannot start upon request.
